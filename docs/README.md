# streamdeck

> An alternative to an Elgato Stream Deck.

## What is this about?

Streamdeck is an app and a python script, developed by two students from Germany, which allows you to use your Phone to remotely control the open-source screen recording program OBS. The app is built entirely with the open-source framework Flutter. The python script on the other hand serves the server and runs inside of OBS to handle the requests coming from the app.

## Why Streamdeck?

- Open Source
- Built only with open source technology
- No big tech companies involved
- Nice and intuitive interface
- Resource-efficient
  - No software running in the background, except a small Python script
- Easy setup
- No external software to install

## Motivation

We always liked the idea of streaming, so we wanted to try it as well. The only problem was that, even though we had two or even three monitors, we would get lost quickly in our streaming setup. That is where normally an Elgato Stream Deck would fit in perfectly. But of course, we did not want to pay for it, so we built it ourselves. And this is how Streamdeck was born.
