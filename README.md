# Streamdeck - Modified Server

 ## An alternative to an Elgato Stream Deck independent of OBS

 Just a modified version of the server.py that allows the user to read the commands issued by the client to execute whatever you want on Linux. The Anrdoid app is the same, just go to the server.py code and modifiy the command section.


### NOTE: You will need to test with the original script to know the scenes and other client command names.
